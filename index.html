  <h2>Build Progress</h2>
  <p>
    The project began with an initial idea of building a car simsulator. We wanted to make a VR-linked RC car driving game that teaches real-world driving skills in a safe, interactive way. 
      Players wear a VR headset to experience lifelike roads while controlling an RC car on a miniature track, completing levels, challenges, and missions that simulate real driving situations. 
      Gamified lessons, instant feedback, and unlockable environments make learning to drive both fun and educational, turning driver’s ed into an engaging game.
