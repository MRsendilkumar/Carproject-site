  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p>
     The project began with an initial idea of building a car simsulator. We wanted to make a VR-linked RC car driving game that teaches real-world driving skills in a safe, interactive way. 
      Players wear a VR headset to experience lifelike roads while controlling an RC car on a miniature track, completing levels, challenges, and missions that simulate real driving situations. 
      Gamified lessons, instant feedback, and unlockable environments make learning to drive both fun and educational, turning driver’s ed into an engaging game.

    Around October, we realized we weren't goinf eb able to scale this project as much as we wanted. We decided to ge a servo to spin left and right while we control the direction with the laptop.
